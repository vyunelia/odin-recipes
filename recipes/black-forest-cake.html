        <p><i>I couldn't bring myself to add the <a href="https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Cake#Recipe">actual recipe</a> from the game, so here's my extremely cheap, knock-off (and even edible) version of it.</i></p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 prepackaged chocolate cake layers</li>
            <li>Heavy cream for crumb coating and filling</li>
            <li>Cherry confiture</li>
            <li>Whipped cream for decoration</li>
            <li>8 candied cherries</li>
            <li>Dark chocolate</li>
            <li>Some cherry liqueur for flavor~</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the confiture on the first cake layer, then spread the heavy cream across it.</li>
            <li>Put the second layer on top of the first one and sprinkle some liqueur over it. Add the confiture and the heavy cream again.</li>
            <li>Put the last layer on top and crumb coat the cake with the heavy cream.</li>
            <li>Grate the chocolate and cover the cake with it.</li>
            <li>For decoration, make 8 roses with whipped cream with candied cherries on top.</li>
        </ol>
